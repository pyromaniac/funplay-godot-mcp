# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- Added state-machine and real-editor HTTP integration tests that launch and stop two Godot instances with distinct per-instance arguments.
- Added a persistent English / Simplified Chinese language selector for the Funplay MCP Dock, including localized controls, status text, tooltips, update checks, and configuration results.
- Added localization catalog, settings persistence, and live Dock switching smoke coverage for both languages.

### Fixed
- Deferred play-mode start and stop operations until after MCP responses are written, preventing multi-instance editor re-entry from producing empty responses and retry-driven relaunch loops.
- Made play-mode calls idempotent, added transition confirmation and timeouts to `get_play_state`, and required explicit `allow_multiple_instances=true` confirmation before launching more than one configured instance.
- Synchronized the generated client configuration and npm wrapper CLI version with the release version.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- GDScript validation now returns Godot's full parser or compiler message with the exact file, line number, and source snippet instead of only an unnumbered reload error code.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Added runtime bridge command tools for play-mode node queries, runtime viewport screenshots, input injection, and runtime event history.
- Added `query_runtime_node`, `capture_runtime_view`, `send_runtime_input`, `get_runtime_events`, and the `godot://runtime/events` resource.
- Added checksum-aware GitHub Release artifact detection to the Dock update checker, including package zip, release manifest, SHA256 sums, and `server.json` readiness.
- Added a Dock dashboard summary for project/server/tool exposure, runtime bridge heartbeat, and release readiness.
- Added `get_dashboard_status` and `godot://dashboard/status` for compact product status snapshots.
- Added local Godot runtime bridge smoke scripts for release validation.

### Fixed
- Cleaned up the Dock update checker HTTP request synchronously on plugin shutdown to avoid Godot headless editor exit warnings.
- Fixed `list_autoloads` so newly saved autoload entries are discovered from `project.godot` even when Godot's runtime property list has not refreshed yet.
- Made runtime bridge command tools wait for a fresh play-mode heartbeat before writing commands, avoiding stale `exit` state races when querying immediately after entering Play Mode.
- Cleared stale runtime command/response files when a new runtime bridge session starts, preventing commands from an older Play Mode session from being replayed.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- Reduced Godot 4.7 .NET editor Dock refresh overhead by caching project language detection and using early-exit script scans instead of repeatedly collecting thousands of files.
- Reused the detected language mode while building tool exposure summaries, preventing duplicate project scans when the Funplay MCP Dock becomes visible.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Keep Godot Asset Store zip packages limited to `addons/funplay_mcp/` plus the required root `LICENSE`, avoiding extra repository Markdown files in end-user project roots.
- Wrap the editor Dock contents in an internal scroll container so Godot 4.7 keeps the bottom Output/Debugger/Animation panel visible when the plugin is enabled.
- Reduce unauthenticated `/health` project fingerprinting and reject non-local POST `Host` headers as defense-in-depth.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Reduced hidden Dock overhead by skipping live UI refreshes while the Funplay MCP tab is not visible
- Deferred expensive Tool Exposure population until the Dock is first shown, avoiding editor layout startup interference
- Added dirty-checks before updating Dock labels and TextEdit contents to reduce repeated Godot UI relayout work

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Fixed Godot 4.6 plugin load failures caused by reserved `class_name` local variables in project map script summarization
- Restricted project file tools and project file resources to normalized `res://` paths that cannot escape the project root through parent-directory traversal

### Security
- Added default local MCP auth tokens, stdio wrapper token forwarding, and one-click client configs that write token-aware stdio entries
- Rejected browser-style MCP POST requests with non-local `Origin` or `Referer` headers while keeping health checks available

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-11
